MIRAGE:MUTUAL SPURIOUS CONSTRAINT FOR FINE-TUNING LARGE VISION LANGUAGE MODELS

We propose MIRAGE (Mutual spurIous constRAint for fine-
tuning large vision lanGuage modEls), a novel fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance the generalization capabilities
of large vision-language models in few-shot scenarios.
